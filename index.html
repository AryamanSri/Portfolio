<p> Aryaman Srivastava is an inquisitive, young lad, with a deep passion for keeping up with the latest trends in tech. Being only 14 years, he doesn't let his age stop him or quit; instead, he uses it to his advantage, making use of the extra time he has to explore as well as study programming along with other hot topics in the field of computer science. He is particularly passionate about AI, and follows the latest developments in the field. 

His journey started in 2019 as an ordinary 8th-grade boy, learning coding from school and some on his own. While playing around with the coding language he was taught in school, he came on to His Recent groundbreaking research as well as programs including Brain Scan Enhancement Assistive Model (BEAM) and Drowsiness Detection System (DDS). In addition to this, he has become the youngest developer to develop a brain scan enhancer in the world. He states, "The main notion of the program I have built was to help as many people as it can, who are currently fighting for their lives, due to late detection of their illness. When symptoms do arise, they are often very generalized and most likely be caused by other conditions. Many areas don’t have technologies like MRI or CT-SCANS and their tumor goes undetected for years and results in the death of the patient. This is why I created this program. My goal is to make tumor detection more efficient and effective with the right technology. I want to provide the best possible options that will assist everyone. AI and ML are the technologies which if used properly can be used to change the world. They are nothing less than a blessing as well as a weapon to reform this world. 
















With proper knowledge as well as tools, we can put these technologies to phenomenal use for better living. The idea of creating a program to detect brain tumors came from statistics that showed it’s causing more than 10000 deaths yearly and I hope that my method might create change by early detection as well as save many lives which are at risk."

“Healthcare is a field that is really ripe to be enhanced by AI.” says Aryaman, who is now focused on enhancing medical imaging processes with the help of AI plans to launch more programs which will benefit the healthcare society and save lives.

Aryaman is only 14 years old and is already working to save lives. He also writes blogs or articles describing his programs. The reason for this is that he believes, "Anyone can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand ~ Martin Fowler". Even after his complex algorithms and programs, he's been able to tell and explain to people how his algorithms work and what each line signifies. 

He's also a known Bot Developer over a social platform called Discord. He developed a multipurpose bot in python named "RKS'' which is used by more than 2 lakh people daily. He expanded his field and created a twitter bot called "AmrevX", the bot name was after the startup Aryaman works for and developed the bot for. His notable contributions to the startup include software applications like word text editor, calculator and game applications. His sideline projects include URL shortener, image classification model as well as his own private browser which works the same as a normal browser with Google Search Engine.

A desirable asset is someone who can demonstrate their worth through arduous and worthwhile effort rather than words. Aryaman is that kind of person. He strives to achieve his ambitions and ensures that he does so. He has a positive attitude towards his passion and the ability to accomplish anything he sets his mind to, and he does so too, even if it means sacrificing everything else in order to achieve his goal. His dedication, perseverance and diligence are what makes him successful, apart from his marvelous skills.

								While we do only one quarter of our driving at night, 50% of traffic deaths happen at night. It doesn’t matter whether the road is familiar or not, driving at night is always more dangerous. More than 40,000 people were killed in car crashes in 2016, according to Injury Facts. The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that as many as 6,000 fatal crashes a year are caused by drowsy driving — in addition to over 40,000 injuries and over 70,000 total crashes. The above report states that more than 50% of deaths due to accidents happen at night. The most common reason is that people feel sleepy or tired due to long time work at the office. Though AI has the perfect solution for it. Using Deep learning and neural networking.It combines the facial landmark and blink detection techniques Many ideas of autonomous, self-driving vehicles argue that the first industry that will be completely and totally overhauled by self-driving cars/trucks (even before consumer vehicles) is the long haul tractor trailer business. When we use raspberry,If a face is found, we apply facial landmark detection and extract the eye regions,Now that we have the eye regions, we can compute the eye aspect ratio to determine if the eyes are closed,If the eye aspect ratio indicates that the eyes have been closed for a sufficiently long enough amount of time, we’ll sound an alarm to wake up the driver This way we can simply just using a laptop and a webcam can prevent night accidents and save lives."</a></b>.
